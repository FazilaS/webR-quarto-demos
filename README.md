# webR-quarto-demos

This repository houses experiments with generating a standalone Quarto Document using Web R.

## Background

[webR v0.1.0](https://twitter.com/gwstagg/status/1633821049329537025) was launched today
by George Stagg ([georgestagg](https://github.com/georgestagg)) and Lionel Henry ([lionel-](https://github.com/lionel-)). The goal of webR is to: 

> to run R code in the browser without the need for an R server to execute the code

This is _amazing_ advancement of _R_ and has ripple effects with teaching!
